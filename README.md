# Markov-Babbler
My implementation of a "Markov Babbler" to generate pseduo-realistic sounding output from user entered input using [Markov Chains of n-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) wrapped around a basic GUI. Supports:
  1. Adding multiple text files or user entered input.
  2. Saving generated results.
  3. Selecting order of markov chain
  4. Switching between using the words of all entered input or only individual characters.
  5. Changing size of output in multiple ways.
